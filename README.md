##PHP Calendar App

**PHP Calendar** is an Events calendar with a few bells and whistles!

The main feature is the ability to register for events. a user clicks on a register link and registers for the event. Admin can turn on/off registration for each event. Another feature is an announcement board for news or more info on events. It comes with two themes to choose from or you can create your own to match your website.

All hail the APP gods!
